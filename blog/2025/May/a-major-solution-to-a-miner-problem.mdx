As the network crypto mining landscape has evolved, thousands of LoRa-based mining devices sit unused in closets and drawers around the world. These once-coveted pieces of hardwareâ€”designed for LoRa-based cryptocurrency mining networksâ€”represent both wasted resources and untapped potential. What if there was a way to repurpose this hardware for something genuinely useful?

These abandoned mining devices can be easily repurposed and transformed into powerful Meshtastic nodes, giving them a new life.

## The Rise and Fall of LoRa Crypto Mining
In the early 2020s, a wave of excitement swept through the technology world as certain projects promised to create wireless networks using LoRa technology by using cryptocurrency mining to incentivize the crowd-sourced formation of that network. Thousands of enthusiasts purchased dedicated mining hardware (essentially LoRa gateways with blockchain capabilities) to participate in building these networks.

Fast forward to today, and many of these miners sit unused due to diminishing returns on mining rewards and the general volatility of cryptocurrency markets or simply loss of interest.

The result? Thousands of perfectly functional devices collecting dust.

## The Hardware Gold Mine

Most LoRa-based miners generally share a common architecture that makes them excellent candidates for conversion:

- Linux-based boards with ample processing power (often based on Raspberry Pi or similar SoCs)
- Adequate power management systems
- Often include Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi connectivity
- Robust enclosures already designed for environmental exposure

While they were built for mining cryptocurrency, these devices contain many of the essential components needed for a linux based Meshtastic node.

## Benefits of Conversion

1. **Environmental Impact**

Repurposing existing hardware reduces electronic waste and extends the useful life of these devices.

2. **Cost Effectiveness**

Converting a miner you already own can be significantly cheaper than purchasing a new dedicated Meshtastic device.

3. **Robust Hardware**

Many mining devices were built with 24/7 outdoor operation in mind and include features that make them ideal for reliable mesh network nodes.

## The Problem and the Conversion Process

## The Problem

The primary issue with converting a mining hardware to a Meshtastic node is that the LoRa concentrator module used in many miners is not compatible with the Meshtastic firmware per-se, as it is specifically designed for LoRaWAN applications, having a number of fixed channels and bandwidth allocation, however we can solve this problem by using a different LoRa module that is compatible with the Meshtastic firmware, such as the Semtech SX1262 or LR11XX series.

### Conversion Overview

The conversion process generally involves:

1. **Software replacement** - Flashing the RaspberryPI OS to replace the mining software and installing Meshtasticd
2. **Hardware modifications** - Minor adaptations to support the Meshtastic feature set
3. **Configuration** - Setting up the node for integration onto the mesh

We'll explore each of these steps in detail.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Converting a Miner

Many miners use a microSD card, but some may have special MMC storage cards. In some cases, the eMMC storage may be preferred due to its robust design.

### 1. Software Replacement
- **Backup**: Before starting, back up any important data from the miner.
- **Flash SD/MMC**: Image the Raspberry Pi OS onto the device's storage option. We used Raspberry Pi Imager for ease of use and pre-configuration of wireless network settings.

### 2. Hardware Modifications

- **Remove the LoRa Concentrator**: If the miner has a dedicated LoRa concentrator module, remove it. This may involve desoldering or disconnecting it from the main board.
- **Install Compatible LoRa Module**: Replace it with a compatible module like the Semtech SX1262 or LR11XX series. Depending on the miner hardware, this may be an option as either a Raspberry Pi HAT or a (CH341) USB + LoRa device. In this case, we used an open-source hardware community USB device: The [Mesh Toad](https://oshwlab.com/mtnmesh/meshtoad-v1-2).

### 3. Configuration
- **Boot the Device**:
Power on the device and ensure it boots into the Raspberry Pi OS.
- **Open an SSH session**:
Connect to the device via SSH.

- **Install Meshtasticd**:
Follow the [Meshtastic installation guide](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/linux/installation/?os=debian) to install Meshtasticd.
- **Configure Meshtasticd and the LoRa radio**:
Run `sudo nano /etc/meshtasticd/config.yaml` and set the parameters for your LoRa device, a MAC address or MAC address source, and any other parameters for your setup.

- **Start up the meshtasticd service**:
Run `sudo systemctl start meshtasticd` to start the Meshtastic daemon.
- **Install python / pipx and Meshtastic python CLI**:
Run `sudo apt install pipx` and `pipx install meshtastic` to install the Meshtastic CLI.
- **Configure the meshtasticd instance**:
Use the Meshtastic CLI to configure the LoRa radio region and set the node name - In this case we ran `meshtastic --set lora.region US --set-owner "The People's Node" --set-owner-short "ðŸŽˆ"`
- **Test the Node**:
Enjoy your success!

### Challenges and Considerations

While conversion is feasible for many devices, there are some challenges to be aware of:

- Some miners may use proprietary hardware that makes conversion difficult
- This could void a Warranty on the product
- Varying levels of technical expertise required

## Summary

As the hardware landscape continues to evolve, repurposing unused mining hardware for Meshtastic represents a sustainable and practical solution that benefits both individual owners and the broader Meshtastic community.

By breathing new life into these devices, we're not just solving a "miner" problem â€” we're contributing to a major solution for off-grid communication.
