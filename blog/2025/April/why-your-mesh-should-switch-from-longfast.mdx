If your local Meshtastic network has grown beyond just a handful of nodes and you're starting to experience issues like delayed messages, network congestion, or inconsistent delivery, the problem might be your LoRa radio preset. Specifically, you may have outgrown the default preset: LongFast.

While LongFast is an excellent general-purpose preset for many users, it may not be the optimal choice for larger or denser meshes. In this post, we will explain why switching to higher bandwidth presets might significantly improve your network's performance.

## Understanding LoRa Presets

Meshtastic devices use LoRa (Long Range) radio to communicate, balancing three key factors: range, speed, and reliability. These factors are controlled through settings like bandwidth, spreading factor, and coding rate, which are conveniently bundled into "presets."

The **default** preset, LongFast, uses 250 kHz bandwidth with a spreading factor of 11. This configuration provides excellent range out of the box but comes at the cost of relatively slow data transmission (about 1 kbps).

Here's how some of the presets compare on paper:

| Preset       | Bandwidth (kHz) | SF     | Data Rate (kbps) | Link Budget | Best For                     |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------ | ---------------: | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| **LongFast** | **250**         | **11** |         **1.07** | **153dB**   | **Default**                  |
| MediumSlow   | 250             | 10     |             1.95 | 150.5dB     | Better speed                 |
| MediumFast   | 250             | 9      |             3.52 | 148dB       | Fast with good range         |
| ShortSlow    | 250             | 8      |             6.25 | 145.5dB     | Fast with moderate range     |
| ShortFast    | 250             | 7      |            10.94 | 143dB       | Very fast, shorter range     |
| ShortTurbo   | 500             | 7      |            21.88 | 140dB       | Maximum speed, minimum range |

## The Problem with LongFast in Large / Dense Networks

While LongFast offers great range, it has drawbacks that become increasingly problematic as your mesh grows:

1. **Increased Airtime**: LongFast messages stay "on the air" longer than some of the faster presets, consuming precious channel time. With slower data rates, each transmission occupies the channel longer, preventing other nodes from transmitting during this window.
2. **Higher Collision Probability**: When multiple nodes try to transmit in a busy network, the chance of packet collisions increases dramatically with slower presets because each transmission blocks the channel for longer.
3. **Reduced Throughput**: The combination of the aforementioned factors leads to lower effective throughput across your entire mesh, even though LongFast seems like it should deliver messages reliably. In a larger or denser network, this can result in service interruption and frustrations for users.

## Benefits of Higher Bandwidth Presets

Switching to higher bandwidth presets like MediumSlow, MediumFast, ShortSlow, or even ShortFast offers a number of advantages:

1. **Reduced Airtime**: Messages are transmitted faster, freeing up the channel for other nodes to communicate.
2. **Lower Collision Probability**: With shorter transmission times, there's less chance that two nodes will try to transmit simultaneously.
3. **Better Scalability**: Higher bandwidth presets are designed to handle more nodes and higher message volumes, making them more suitable for larger deployments. In dense networks, the improved throughput often more than compensates for the slightly reduced range, resulting in better overall message delivery.
4. **Lower Latency**: Messages travel through the mesh more quickly, reducing delays that can be frustrating for users.

## When Should You Switch?

You should perhaps consider moving away from LongFast if your mesh has:

- **More than 60 nodes**, especially if they are in relatively close proximity
- **High message volume** from many users or automated systems
- **An Urban / suburban deployments** where maximizing range is less important than throughput
- **Experienced message delays** or inconsistent delivery due to congestion

### Recommended Alternatives

#### For Extremely Dense Networks

**ShortFast** or **ShortSlow** - These presets offer the highest data rates, dramatically reducing channel congestion. While the range is shorter, urban deployments typically have nodes close enough together that this might not be a significant problem.

#### For Dense Urban / Suburban Networks

**MediumFast** or **MediumSlow** - These presets strike an excellent balance between range and speed, offering 3-4 times the data rate of LongFast while still maintaining respectable range.

## How to Make the Change

Switching presets is straightforward but requires updating all nodes in your mesh:

1. **Web UI**: Navigate to Radio > LoRa and change the "Modem Preset" dropdown
2. **Meshtastic CLI**: Use the command `meshtastic --set lora.modem_preset MEDIUM_FAST` or similar
3. **Android/iOS App**: Go to Settings > Radio > LoRa > Modem Preset

Remember: All nodes in your mesh should use the same preset in order to remain in the network.

Please review the [LoRa Config](/docs/configuration/radio/lora/) page for more information.

### Real-World Success

Many larger Meshtastic deployments have seen substantial improvements after switching from LongFast, one of those is the Meshtastic Bay Area Group:

#### Meshtastic Bay Area Group

 Meshtastic Bay Area Group is a community mesh in the San Francisco Bay Area that switched their preset over to MediumSlow. Here's their testimonial on this change:
 
Our mesh of over 150 nodes is currently thriving after switching to the MediumSlow preset which has proven to be extremely beneficial. It started as an experiment to escape the saturated default LongFast channel that had a lot of nodes using old firmware or misconfigured nodes spamming the mesh.

Here’s what makes it work:
1. **Intentional coordination**: Our switch to MediumSlow was carefully planned. Node roles were thoughtfully assigned, timers tuned, and the network structure optimized for coverage and reliability. Regular coordination—on and off the mesh—means issues are quickly identified and resolved. The human layer behind the tech is a key part of our success
2. **Less background clutter:** MediumSlow isn’t the default preset, so we avoid the legacy traffic clutter from years of LongFast usage. That alone makes a huge difference in network clarity.

    3.    Modern firmware and best practices across all nodes
Since the migration was recent and deliberate, nearly every device is running up-to-date firmware, reducing bugs and improving consistency. We stick to good practices in settings and attempt to reduce any unnecessary traffic that would not provide a positive impact.

4. **Strategic node placement:** We reserve router mode for high-elevation nodes, ensuring wide coverage without unnecessary redundancy. Altitude matters—and we use it to our advantage. We sometimes place 2 routers at opposite ends of a given area, to provide high likelihood of line-of-sight.
5. **Embrace curiosity and experimentation:** We often test limits, run experiments and generally "try things" to learn and test assumptions. This ensures that the mesh performance and behavior is understood and changes are backed by impact and repeatable science.

### Getting others to switch / Dealing with FOMO

If you're in a community or group where others are still using LongFast, consider sharing your experiences and the benefits you've seen. You can also help them understand the trade-offs involved in switching presets.
This can be a great opportunity to educate others about the importance of network optimization and how it can lead to a better experience for everyone.
For those who are hesitant to switch, remind them that the default LongFast setting is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Encourage them to experiment with different presets and find what works best for their specific deployment.

Some groups that have switched to a higher-bandwidth preset have left a bot on the LongFast preset to send messages redirecting those who haven't switched yet to the new channel. This allows for a transition and ensures that no one is left out of the new network while they consider the change.

## So long, LongFast!

While LongFast is an excellent default setting that balances range and speed for small to medium-sized networks, larger or denser deployments often benefit significantly from switching to higher bandwidth presets.

The slightly reduced theoretical range is usually offset by improved reliability, lower latency, and better overall user experience, especially in scenarios where nodes are relatively close together.

If your mesh has grown beyond a handful of nodes or you're experiencing congestion-related issues, it's worth experimenting with alternative presets to find the optimal configuration for your mesh.
